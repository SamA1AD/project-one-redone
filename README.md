project 1 redone

My original project collapsed due to youtube tutorials, and using code I did not understand to make a frankestin version of my project. This one is a little better although I did follow another youtube tutorial...it was a mistake. At least the failure of my project has shown be that I need to redirect my efforts and focus on a few areas where I am lacking.

Once you open the project you will see a sidebar on the left hand side. Expand this by clicking the arrow Icon. In the search section type in a citiy and state in this format: Clarksville, tn. This will send a api request to find the coordinates of the city, then send another api request to fetch the weather data. Under the search bar you will see a target Icon, this icon will have the name of the city where the weather data is coming from. This confirms to the user the correct location was inputed. On the right hand side you will see 10 forcasted temperatures incrementing every three hours. 

If you click on the tables tab on the sidebar it will take you to a new html file. Type in a city on the top left in the same format as the home page. This will pull for information for that location.
